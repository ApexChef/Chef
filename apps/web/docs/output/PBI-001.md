**Type:** feature
**Final Score:** 82.5/100 (Good)
**Risk Level:** medium
**Status:** auto_approved

## Description

Implement a secure password reset API endpoint that validates user emails, generates time-limited reset tokens, stores token hashes securely, sends reset emails, and includes rate limiting for security. The endpoint should return 200 OK regardless of email existence to prevent email enumeration attacks.

```

### Raw Meeting Context

```
First, we need a "Forgot Password" API endpoint. When a user submits their email, the system should: 1. Validate the email exists in our database 2. Generate a secure reset token with 24-hour expiration 3. Store the token hash in the database (never store plain tokens) 4. Send an email with the reset link containing the token 5. Return 200 OK regardless of whether email exists (security best practice) 6. Rate limit to 3 requests per email per hour
```
