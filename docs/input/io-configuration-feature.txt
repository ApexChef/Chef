Meeting Notes: Chef I/O Configuration Feature Discussion
Date: 2024-12-22
Attendees: Product Team

DISCUSSION SUMMARY:

We need to define where Chef reads input from and where it writes output to. Currently everything is hardcoded - input is a single text file, output goes to ./docs/output/. This limits adoption and flexibility.

KEY DECISIONS:

1. INPUT SOURCES - Where meeting notes come from:
   - Local files (.txt, .md, .docx)
   - Directory scanning (process all files in a folder)
   - Clipboard/stdin (pipe content directly)
   - URLs (fetch from web/wiki)
   - Future: Confluence, Notion, Google Docs APIs

2. OUTPUT DESTINATIONS - Where PBIs are exported:
   - Local markdown files (current behavior)
   - JSON files (for tooling integration)
   - YAML files (for GitOps workflows)
   - stdout (for piping to other tools)
   - Future: Jira, Azure DevOps, GitHub Issues, Linear

3. CONFIGURATION APPROACH:
   - CLI flags for one-off overrides
   - Config file (.chefrc.yaml or chef.config.yaml) for project defaults
   - Environment variables for CI/CD pipelines

ACTION ITEMS:

- Create InputConfig and OutputConfig types in @chef/core
- Add --input-format and --output-dir flags to CLI
- Support config file loading with sensible defaults
- Document supported formats and destinations

RISKS IDENTIFIED:

- Scope creep with too many integrations
- Breaking changes to existing CLI interface
- Authentication complexity for external services

PRIORITY: High - this is foundational for adoption
